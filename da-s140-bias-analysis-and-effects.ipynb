Motivation is the driving force behind every success story. It's the spark that ignites the flame of determination, the fuel that keeps us going, and the inspiration that propels us forward.\n\nNo matter what your goals or aspirations may be, it all starts with motivation. Whether you're striving for a promotion at work, training for a marathon, or simply trying to live a healthier lifestyle, motivation is what will get you there.\n\nBut staying motivated isn't always easy. There will be times when you feel like giving up, when the road ahead seems too long, or when you face obstacles that seem insurmountable. But remember, it's during these times that your motivation is truly put to the test.\n\nIt's important to keep in mind that motivation is not something that just happens to you. It's something that you create within yourself. You need to be the one who fuels that fire, who keeps that determination burning bright.\n\nOne of the best ways to stay motivated is to keep your eye on the prize. Visualize what it is that you want to achieve, and keep that image in your mind's eye. Let it be a constant reminder of what you're working towards, and why you started in the first place.\n\nAnother key to staying motivated is to surround yourself with positive people. Seek out individuals who support and encourage you, and who will cheer you on when you're feeling discouraged. These people will be your biggest advocates, and will help you to stay focused on your goals.\n\nSo remember, motivation is the key to success. It's what separates those who achieve their dreams from those who fall short. So stay focused, stay determined, and never give up. With hard work, dedication, and a little bit of motivation, you can accomplish anything you set your mind to.\n\nThank you.\"\"\",\n    \"\"\"\n    What is wrong with people? How can anyone think that wearing socks with sandals is a good idea? It's a complete and utter fashion disaster that should never be attempted.\n\nLet me break it down for you: socks and sandals serve completely different purposes. Socks are meant to keep your feet warm and protect them from friction, while sandals are supposed to allow your feet to breathe and provide airflow. These two things simply do not go together, and anyone who thinks otherwise is completely clueless.\n\nAnd let's talk about the aesthetic of this abomination. Socks and sandals look terrible together. Sandals are supposed to showcase the natural shape and beauty of the foot, but when you add socks to the mix, you completely ruin the look. You end up with a lumpy, shapeless mess that is not only unflattering but also embarrassing to look at.\n\nOn top of all that, wearing socks with sandals is just plain confusing. Sandals are typically associated with casual outdoor activities, the beach, or the pool, while socks are more suited to colder weather or formal occasions. Combining the two just doesn't make sense and creates a disjointed look that's confusing to everyone around you.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the message that wearing socks with sandals sends to others. It communicates a complete lack of concern for fashion and tells the world that you're just too lazy to care. It's a terrible message to send and makes you look like a complete slob.\n\nSo please, for the love of all that is good and holy, stop wearing socks with sandals. It's a fashion mistake of epic proportions, and anyone who does it deserves to be ridiculed and shamed. Let's all just agree to leave this trend in the past where it belongs and move on to more fashionable choices.\"\"\",\n    \"\"\n    \n]","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def predict(s):\n    s = s.replace('\\n',' ')\n    s = s.replace('  ', ' ')\n    return [model.predict(np.array([s])), imdb_model.predict(np.array[s])]","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"for i in prediction_sentences:\n    print(i)\n    print(f'the sentiment is {predict(i)[0]} for the sentiment140 model and {predict(i)[1]} for the imdb model')","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
